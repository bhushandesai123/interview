LOST PEM KEY SOLUTION 
1 TAKE AMI AND CREATE NEW INSTANCE FROM IT AND USE THAT INSTANCE BUT IP GET CHANGED
2 FROM EBS
--->  2  FROM EBS
DETACH 1ST EC2 EBS
ATTACH IT TO NEW 2ND EC2
COPY .SSH FOLDER FROM NEW EC2 TO OLD EC2 EBS
DETACH OLD EC2 EBS 
AGAIN ATTACH TO OLD EC2
THEN USE KEY OF NEW EC2 TO CONNECT
